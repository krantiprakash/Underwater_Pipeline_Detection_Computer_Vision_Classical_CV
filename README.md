# Underwater_Pipeline_Detection_Computer_Vision_Classical_CV
This project focuses on detecting underwater pipelines using classical computer vision methods. The detection process involves analyzing underwater images with traditional image processing and computer vision algorithms, rather than relying on deep learning or neural network-based approaches.
# Project Folder Structure

This project folder contains two main folders and an image set folder.

### Folders:

1. **New Pipeline Folder**
   - Contains the newly developed pipeline.
   - Code is in the `FINAL_PIPELINE.ipynb` Python Notebook file.

2. **Research**
   - Contains the implementation of the research paper pipeline.
   - Code is in the `Research_paper_implementation.ipynb` Python Notebook file.

3. **Images_set**
   - Contains all the images we have tested or tried during the execution.
   - Alternatively, access the image set through this [drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jCWN-UEeqK3R4FG0b5iPB0WFVzLpjtpF?usp=drive_link).

### Running the Notebooks:

- **We used Google Colab to run the notebook files.**

  **To run on Google Colab:**
  1. Download the notebook file.
  2. Upload and run directly on Google Colab.

  **To run locally (VS Code or Jupyter Notebook):**
  1. Download the notebook file and the image set.
  2. Specify the path to the image set folder in the notebook.
